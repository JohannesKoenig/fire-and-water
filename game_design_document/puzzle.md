# Puzzle
Puzzle is the "content" of a level.
Puzzles are configuration of puzzle mechanics.

Example:
- Walk to the exit in a straight line (most simple)
- Collect a key, walk to lock (gate) which unlocks with key and gates the exit

- not always both players necessary to complete (not both specialties / abilities). Could somtimes also just be both running through the level 
- no way for players to lock themselves in a position where they cannot finish the level
- possibility to only be able to collect all collectables if order of puzzles is followed
- level "bonuses" can be locked by player decisions
- a puzzle is unique and will not appear again
- not necessarily limited to a single solution to the puzzle - there can be multiple ways to solve the puzzle
