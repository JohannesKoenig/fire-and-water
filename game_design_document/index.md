# Fire and Water

Inspiration: https://www.1001spiele.de/fireboy-watergirl?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADgnin3oS_mW3xSaHI-OY6p9Ce8ub&gclid=CjwKCAjwk8e1BhALEiwAc8MHiPiCvz8g6AEkrmS4QwS0Z2auf2A-M0z80PEJOvqWVFWDlpQiCSJtABoCKmIQAvD_BwE#

Art style: Pixel art

Transitions:
Split levels -> if a level is completed you will be spawned in the next level -> Portal / door to show player where to go

Level selection: No menu to go back to older levels

Core game features: 
- work together
- solve puzzles
- platforming
- 

Features we found:
- if one player dies the level is reset
- physics (gravity + collisions)
- collectable diamonds / coins for 100% completion
- buttons and levers to move doors and platforms
- dangers to the players (puddles of fire and water)
- players represent opposites
- time counter for 100% completion
- tool tips in level
- tutorial
- game overview map / level selection restricted by progress
- music
- game save
- no sound effects beside jump
- jingle on death
- background music
- progression of difficulty
- new features in later levels (fan, rotating platforms)

Ideas and thoughts:
- give players async abilities (dash and double jump for example)
- time limit
- optional level select if time
