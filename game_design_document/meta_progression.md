# Meta progression

- when a level is finished you get feedback on your performance (time, collectibles) and the ability to restart this level or move to the next level
- start of the game: level 1, tutorial
- progress story, get new mechanic every x level
- end of the game: last level, complex puzzle, resolution of story
